When I decided I'd be rebuilding my site, the question of "to what form" came to mind. I wanted a site that was contrarian, and didn't conform the the homogenous blob of portfolio sites. Besides, this is less of a portfolio site, and more my home on the interwebs. What I wanted, and needed, was a site that was just as ambiguous as the goal I set out to complete.

## Fascination with Digital Assistants

So some context is perhaps helpful. Throughout my career, I've pursued interest in many different areas. Unsuccessful game development, knowledge base management, etc. However, the one thing that always draws me further in is the field of conversational AI. Being able to disect human language, and turn it into action is a fascinating one. This interest usually manifests itself in some form of a digital assistant. Check out my [github](https://github.com/AidanTilgner?tab=repositories) for more information on that.

The important takeaway, is that I love working with natural language, and building out conversational experiences. Perhaps this is fed by my learning style, which is primarily the consumption of conversation-based formats (podcasts, interviews, etc.). It could be related to my goal of creating a real-life "JARVIS" system, since I saw Iron Man a few too many times.

## Internet Archeology

As the years progress, I will get older, and eventually I will die. When I die, I hope to leave behind some evidence for my existence, and the existence of other things that may be considered interesting. Apart from techniques in [making webpages last](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/) that I hope to employ, I'd like my site to act as a receptical for useful information. [Future internet archeologists](/blog/dear-future-internet-historians) will come accross this site and hopefully find it to be a rich source of information on their hunt for knowledge about their past.

## Fun Things

I'm a tinkerer. As a tinkerer, I like to build stuff, and play with new concepts, figure out how things work, and poke around. I'd like my site to be a repository of all of the things that I've worked on, and a nexus to connect them all. I have a lot of ideas, and putting all of my projects, or at least interfaces to them, in one place, might be a good way to build a complex, functional system, and eventually JARVIS someday.

## Putting it all Together

So why does this matter? Well, this is all background to why my site is the way that it is, and then how it actually works.
