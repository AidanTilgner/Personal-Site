What's old is new again and what's new has become old.

I had a nicely designed, clean website. It was complete with a carefully picked color pallete, a user-friendly design, and made excellent use of professional-sounding marketing language. However, there was one noteable issue... it was so boring.

It all started when I was watching [this video](https://youtu.be/cEqGWyq-HJs), which is a masterclass in video essay-ing. The internet used to be more than this homogenous blob of social media sites and data collection. If you wanted a web presence, you had to construct it, and man what a web it was. After taking a look at [this beauty](https://www.dvd3000.ca/), which [Nathan](https://nimo.is/) found on [wiby](https://wiby.me/), that a website is more than a collection of marketing material for job recruiters.

Your website is your home on the internet. So make it how you would want your home to be! Reject the aesthetic of a neat and tidy, picturesque home! Embrace the home that is lived in, and gets a little cluttered because it's full of the things you love.

Obviously, your website is probably a lot less important than your real-life home, but you get my point. Basically, I'm trying to do my own part to revitalize the web, and bring it back to the eclectic, beautiful monstrosity that it was before some nerds went and cleaned it all up.
